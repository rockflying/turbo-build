======== TestCase ========
YellowBook1


======== Problem ========
This project relies on europeyellowbook.jar (built from EuropeYellowBook1 project), 
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v2.jar.
However, mudam-lib-v2.jar is not included in europeyellowbook.jar, 
so it makes sense that there is a NoSuchMethodError when launch this project.


======== Exception ========
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String;
	at org.europeyellowbook.EuropeYellowBook.getMudamAddress(EuropeYellowBook.java:10)
	at org.yellowbook.YellowBook.main(YellowBook.java:14)
	
	
======== Analysis ========
This example shows a NoSuchMethodError, which does not contain that method in this project.
Thus, this case is normal situations that NoSuchMethodError occurs.

Our approach is going to solve the problem of NoSuchMethodError in the case that 
the expected method does exist in the class-path.
In other words, we are going to detect such NoSuchMethodError exceptions that is probably caused by library conflicts.

The possible solution should at least report that method org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String;
does not exist in the current class path.
e.g., by taking the method as input.
