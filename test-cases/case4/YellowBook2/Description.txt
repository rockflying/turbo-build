======== TestCase ========
YellowBook2


======== Problem ========
This project relies on europeyellowbook.jar (built from EuropeYellowBook1 project),
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v2.jar
and luxembourgyellowbook.jar (built from LuxembourgYellowBook1 project), 
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v1.jar.
In this case, europeyellowbook.jar and luxembourgyellowbook.jar are conflicted.
Since luxembourgyellowbook.jar is loaded before europeyellowbook.jar, 
the Mudam class in europeyellowbook.jar will be ignored and 
consequently cause method org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String; cannot found error.

======== Exception ========
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String;
	at org.europeyellowbook.EuropeYellowBook.getMudamAddress(EuropeYellowBook.java:16)
	at org.yellowbook.YellowBook.main(YellowBook.java:14)
	
	
======== Analysis ========
This test case shows a basic NoSuchMethodError, which is caused by library conflicts.
Since class Mudam in europeyellowbook.jar is backward compatible with class Mudam in luxembourgyellowbook.jar,
if the system first load europeyellowbook.jar and then luxembourgyellowbook.jar,
the problem would be solved.

The possible solution should be able to detect this kind of NoSuchMethodError and 
automatically fix this problem.
