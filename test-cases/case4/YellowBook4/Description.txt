======== TestCase ========
YellowBook4


======== Problem ========
This project relies on EuropeYellowBook1 project, which is further relying on mudam-lib-v2.jar
and LuxembourgYellowBook1, which is further relying on mudam-lib-v1.jar.
In this case, EuropeYellowBook1 and LuxembourgYellowBook1 are conflicted.
Since LuxembourgYellowBook1 is loaded before EuropeYellowBook1 project, 
the Mudam class in EuropeYellowBook1 will be ignored and 
consequently cause method org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String; cannot found error.

======== Exception ========
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String;
	at org.europeyellowbook.EuropeYellowBook.getMudamAddress(EuropeYellowBook.java:16)
	at org.yellowbook.YellowBook.main(YellowBook.java:14)
	
	
======== Analysis ========
This test case shows a basic NoSuchMethodError, which is caused by library conflicts.  
Since class Mudam in EuropeYellowBook1 is backward compatible with class Mudam in LuxembourgYellowBook1,
if the system first load EuropeYellowBook1 and then LuxembourgYellowBook1,
the problem would be solved.

The possible solution should be able to detect this kind of NoSuchMethodError and 
automatically fix this problem.
This test case is similar to case YellowBook3, the difference is that the project only relies on
other projects (no libraries are relied), the possible solution should be aware on this.
