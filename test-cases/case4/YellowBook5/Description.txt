======== TestCase ========
YellowBook5


======== Problem ========
This project relies on europeyellowbook.jar (built from EuropeYellowBook2 project), 
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v3.jar.
and luxembourgyellowbook.jar (built from LuxembourgYellowBook1 project), 
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v1.jar.
In this case, europeyellowbook.jar and luxembourgyellowbook.jar are conflicted.


======== Exception ========
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String;
	at org.europeyellowbook.EuropeYellowBook.getMudamAddress(EuropeYellowBook.java:10)
	at org.yellowbook.YellowBook.main(YellowBook.java:14)
	
	
======== Analysis ========
This test case shows a NoSuchMethodError, which is caused by library conflicts.
The worse thing is that class Mudam in both europeyellowbook.jar and 
luxembourgyellowbook.ja is not compatible with one another.
That means simply change the library loading sequence is not enough to solve this problem. 

The possible solution should:
1) first report this kind of conflict, which cannot be solved through changing the library loading sequence.
2) suggest possible solution for this conflict.
3) automatically solve it.
