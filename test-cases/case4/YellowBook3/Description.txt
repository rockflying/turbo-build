======== TestCase ========
YellowBook3


======== Problem ========
This project relies on EuropeYellowBook1 project, 
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v2.jar
and luxembourgyellowbook.jar (built from LuxembourgYellowBook1 project), 
which is further relying on mudam-lib-v1.jar.
In this case, EuropeYellowBook1 and luxembourgyellowbook.jar are conflicted.
Since luxembourgyellowbook.jar is loaded before EuropeYellowBook1 project, 
the Mudam class in EuropeYellowBook1 will be ignored and 
consequently cause method org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String; cannot found error.

======== Exception ========
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.mudam.Mudam.getAddress(Z)Ljava/lang/String;
	at org.europeyellowbook.EuropeYellowBook.getMudamAddress(EuropeYellowBook.java:16)
	at org.yellowbook.YellowBook.main(YellowBook.java:14)
	
	
======== Analysis ========
This test case shows a basic NoSuchMethodError, which is caused by library conflicts.  
Since class Mudam in EuropeYellowBook1 is backward compatible with class Mudam in luxembourgyellowbook.jar,
if the system first load EuropeYellowBook1 and then luxembourgyellowbook.jar,
the problem would be solved.

The possible solution should be able to detect this kind of NoSuchMethodError and 
automatically fix this problem.
This test case is similar to case YellowBook2, the difference is that the project directly relies on
other projects, the possible solution should be aware on this.
